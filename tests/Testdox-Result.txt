BlueM\Tree
 [x] Get the root nodes
 [x] Get all nodes
 [x] Get a node by its id
 [x] Trying to get a node by its id throws an exception if the id is invalid
 [x] Get a node by its value path
 [x] Trying to get a node by its value path returns null if no node matches
 [x] The tree is returned as string in scalar context
 [x] Get the root nodes for data with string keys
 [x] Get all nodes for data with string keys
 [x] Get a node by its id for data with string keys
 [x] An exception is thrown when an invalid parent id is referenced
 [x] An exception is thrown when a node would be its own parent
 [x] An exception is thrown when a node would be its own parent when own id and parent id have different types
 [x] When mixing numeric and string ids no exception is thrown due to implicit typecasting
